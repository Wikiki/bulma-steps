# :exclamation: Abandoned :exclamation:
As you may have noticed, this package has not been updated for some time. I'm sorry, but unfortunately I'm not able to continue to maintain it, so I recommand the use of one available alternative:
- [Bulma Steps by aramvisser](https://github.com/aramvisser/bulma-steps).
- [Bulma O Step by octoshrimpy])(https://octoshrimpy.github.io/bulma-o-steps/)

If you're intersted in taking it over and maintain it, please contact me at wikiki@protonmail.com to discuss how to proceed.

There is another steps extensions for Bulma available from

Thanks to him for the ```marker``` name idea and for the sizes mixin declaration (which is smart).
